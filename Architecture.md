# Spaghetti

Spaghetti, or Big Ball Of Mud [(2)]http://www.laputan.org/mud/, is a perfectly valid architecture [(1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WqYQ1OwxJ4).
It refers to a software where everything is just clumped together with dependencies going everywhere.
When doing this, at least strive to keep the spaghetti length as short as possible.
One view of a "spaghetti" is as a chain of dependencies.
