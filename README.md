# LearningProgramming

A bunch of notes and code snippets that I write while figuring out how to design, write and debug programs.
I use this repository for notes that don't fit into any of the more specific repositories such as [LearningCpp](https://github.com/ibbles/LearningCpp), [LearningPython](https://github.com/ibbles/LearningPython), [LearningCMake](https://github.com/ibbles/LearningCMake), or [LearningGoogleAppsScript](https://github.com/ibbles/LearningGoogleAppsScript).
I'm unsure what the organization should be long-term.
Should some of the old repositories be merged into this  one?
Should I create new repositories from notes in this one once a particular topic has grown numerous?
What should the criteria be for deciding whether a note should go into this repository or if a new repository should be created for that topic?
